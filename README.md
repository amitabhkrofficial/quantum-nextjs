**Quantum is a 2kb, zero-dependency atomic state machine for server-first React apps.**

It's built from the ground up for the Next.js App Router and React Server Components. No boilerplate. No providers. Just state.

## ðŸš€ The Philosophy

State management is too complex. `quantum-state` is the brutalist, no-nonsense solution.

* **1. Atomic & Zero-Boilerplate:** No reducers, no actions, no dispatchers. Define a single 'quantum' of state (an `atom`) and use it anywhere. Components subscribe directly to only the atoms they need.
* **2. "Quantum" Microtask Batching:** Why 2kb? It's all in the scheduler. `quantum-state` automatically batches all state updates within a single event loop tick. This provides extreme performance for high-frequency updates (e.g., real-time CSI data, financial tickers) with zero re-render tearing.
* **3. Server-First Native:** This is not an old library with a new wrapper. It's built for the App Router. You can safely pass state from Server Components to Client Components. It's free of 'context provider hell.'

## âš¡ Installation

```bash
npm install quantum-state
